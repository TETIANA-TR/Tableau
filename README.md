### 📌 Tasks Completed:
- Built sheets to analyze and visualize company revenue data:
  - **Total monthly revenue**
  - **Monthly revenue by location**
  - **Revenue by product**
  - **Revenue comparison by location + product**
  - **Revenue comparison by location**
  - **Monthly revenue by product with color-coded breakdown**
  - **ARPPU and number of paying users by month**
  - **Box plot for transaction amount distribution**
  - **Share of each location in total revenue over time**
- Created a **dashboard** with 6 sheets:
  - Added filters by **location, product, and date**
  - Filters apply to all charts on the dashboard
- Implemented revenue metrics:
  - **New MRR** – revenue from new users in their first paid month
  - Combined chart: **Total revenue** (axis 1) + **% change from previous month** (axis 2)
- Built a **cohort analysis table**:
  - Rows = first month when a user became paying
  - Columns = months since first payment
  - Values = revenue for that cohort period
  - Gradient formatting to highlight relative changes
