Task (step by step):
In Tableau Public, I created a workbook (new visualization)
in which I built sheets with the following data:
1. Total monthly cash receipts
2. Total monthly cash receipts broken down by location
3. Total cash receipts for each of the company's products
4. A chart that allows you to visually to compare the total Revenue for each location + product combination.
5. A chart that allows you to compare the total Revenue for each location.
6. A chart that shows the total Revenue by month broken down by product. The breakdown is color-coded.
7. Chart showing ARPPU and Paid Users Count by month.
8. Built a box plot to compare transaction amounts.
9. Created a chart showing how each location's share of Revenue changes over time.
10. Created a dashboard and added 6 sheets to it from this and the previous task. Added filters to the dashboard with location, product, and date. The filters apply to all charts on the dashboard.
11. New MRR is the amount of revenue generated from new users during the calendar month they became paid.
12. Total Revenue on one vertical axis and the percentage change in Total Revenue from the previous month on the second axis.
13. Table for cohort analysis of Revenue from users:
    The rows show the first month when the user became a paid user.
    The columns show the number of months that have passed since the first month of payment.
    The table displays the Total Revenue values ​​for the corresponding period for the corresponding cohort.
    The table is filled with a gradient based on the ratio of the amount of Revenue in the corresponding cell to the amount of Revenue in the first month of the cohort.
14. I collected the last three sheets into one dashboard and added filters by location and date to the dashboard.
