# ðŸ“Š Tableau Projects by Tetiana Trotska

This repository contains my practice projects and PET projects created in **Tableau Public**.  
The goal is to demonstrate data analytics, data visualization, and dashboard design skills.

## ðŸ”¹ Project: Introduction to Tableau
**Link to Dashboard:** [View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book4_17467082423910/revenue_product?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks Completed:
- Built sheets to analyze and visualize company revenue data:
  - **Total monthly revenue**
  - **Monthly revenue by location**
  - **Revenue by product**
  - **Revenue comparison by location + product**
  - **Revenue comparison by location**
  - **Monthly revenue by product with color-coded breakdown**
  - **ARPPU and number of paying users by month**
  - **Box plot for transaction amount distribution**
  - **Share of each location in total revenue over time**
- Created a **dashboard** with 6 sheets:
  - Added filters by **location, product, and date**
  - Filters apply to all charts on the dashboard
- Implemented revenue metrics:
  - **New MRR** â€“ revenue from new users in their first paid month
  - Combined chart: **Total revenue** (axis 1) + **% change from previous month** (axis 2)
- Built a **cohort analysis table**:
  - Rows = first month when a user became paying
  - Columns = months since first payment
  - Values = revenue for that cohort period
  - Gradient formatting to highlight relative changes

### ðŸ›  Key Features:
- Multiple visualization types: line charts, bar charts, box plots, combinational charts, cohort tables  
- Interactive filters for flexible analysis  
- Business-oriented metrics (MRR, ARPPU, revenue growth)  
- Cohort analysis for long-term revenue dynamics

ðŸš€ **Next Steps**: More Tableau dashboards covering advanced analytics, comparisons, and business insights will be added here.
